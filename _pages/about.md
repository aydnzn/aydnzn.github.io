<!-- ## 👋 Hey there!

I studied electrical engineering at Technische Universität München, where I obtained my master’s degree. 

Before my masters? I secured dual bachelor's degrees from _Boğaziçi University_ in Istanbul, diving deep into electrical electronics engineering and mathematics. Earlier, I also had the privilege to attend _Istanbul Erkek Lisesi_, a distinguished German International School that laid a strong foundation for me.

My academic endeavors have spanned a range of topics, enriching my expertise in various domains.
<!-- During my time there, I ventured into fascinating research areas, such as Signal processing, LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection, Electromagnetics.   -->
<!-- 
### 🔍 Signal Processing
From understanding core concepts like Digital Signal Processing to delving into specialized areas like Audio Technology and Machine Learning, my expertise spans a broad spectrum in this domain.

### 🧠 Neuroscience & Engineering:
My work in Neuroengineering combines intricate signal processing techniques with computational neuroscience. It provides a profound comprehension of neural signals, sensory processing, and clinical applications in computational medicine.

### 📡 Electromagnetic & Environmental Systems:
The design of implantable antennas and the study of electrodynamics form the core of my knowledge in this area, supported by practical experience from my research internship.

### 📐 Mathematics
My dual bachelor's degrees allowed for an intensive exploration into foundational and advanced mathematical concepts, providing me with tools to approach complex engineering challenges.

Throughout my academic journey, I've mastered a variety of programming languages and tools.  My diverse background offers a well-rounded perspective to engineering.

Outside the realm of tech, I indulge in:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running
- 🚴‍♂️ Biking adventures
- 🏀 Playing basketball
- 📜 Studying ancient philosophy

## 👋 Hello!

I studied electrical engineering at Technische Universität München and earned my master's degree there. 

Before that, I got two bachelor's degrees from Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, focusing on electrical engineering and math. I also went to Istanbul Erkek Lisesi, a notable German school.

I've learned a lot in different areas during my studies:

### 🔍 Signal Processing
I know basics like Digital Signal Processing and more specific things like Audio Technology and Machine Learning.

### 🧠 Neuroscience & Engineering:
I've combined signal processing with neuroscience. This helps me understand brain signals, how we sense things, and uses in medicine.

### 📡 Electromagnetics:
I've learned about things like designing antennas and the basics of electrodynamics. I also did a research internship.

### 📐 Math
Thanks to my two bachelor's degrees, I've studied many math topics, helping me solve tough engineering problems.

I've learned many programming languages and tools during my studies. This makes me a well-rounded engineer.

When I'm not working, I enjoy:
- 🏃‍♂️ Running
- 🚴‍♂️ Biking
- 🏀 Basketball
- 📜 Reading old philosophy
